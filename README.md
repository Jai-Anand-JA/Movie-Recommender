# Movie-Recommender

Movie Recommender System
This project is a movie recommender system implemented in Python utilizing machine learning techniques. The recommender system incorporates two different approaches: popularity-based and content-based recommendation systems.

Popularity-Based Recommender
The popularity-based recommender suggests movies based on their overall popularity among users. It doesn't take into account the specific preferences or characteristics of individual users. This approach is useful for suggesting popular or trending movies to a wide audience.

Content-Based Recommender
The content-based recommender suggests movies based on the similarities between movies' content features. It analyzes attributes such as genre, director, actors, and plot summary to recommend movies with similar characteristics to those that the user has liked previously. This approach is more personalized as it takes into account individual preferences and can recommend niche or lesser-known movies that align with the user's tastes.

Implementation
The system is implemented using Python programming language and leverages popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn for building and training the recommendation models. The dataset used for training and testing the models includes information about movies such as title, genre, director, actors, and user ratings.

Usage
To use the movie recommender system, simply run the Python script provided in this repository. Users can input their preferences, and the system will generate recommendations based on either the popularity-based or content-based approach, depending on the chosen mode.
